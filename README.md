## About The Project

<img src="./docs/js-game-screenshot.gif" width="auto" height="auto" />

It is a HTML5 game developed with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game development library. The he game inspired from this [Space Shooter project](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) and implemented by using game development best practices as much as possible.

Several features are developed to work differently for the mobile devices specifically, becuase there is not keybaord in mobile devices and other way of player relocation must be done.

- Player and enemy powers (healths) are displayed on the top of the screen.
- There are extra disturbors in the game, there are stones. Player's power gets lower when they touch to player. However, the player can detroy them by fire bullet to them and can get score.
